      <h4>Extra Ordinary</h4>
      <p>The staff at RBC have a love for beer with great hop characteristics.
        Therefore, we have labored and tested how we can overhop this XO to get the best result.
        We have used five different varieties if hops.
        When the mals was cooked we added Columbus, Simce and Mosaic.
        During the fermentation we twice did dry hopping the brwe with Amarilli, Citra and Mosaic.</p>

      <p>As yuo probably have understood XO is an IPA characterised by hopflavour.
        You will feel the aromas and flavours of citrus, pine and tropical fruit.
        The mail body bas a certain caramelity.
